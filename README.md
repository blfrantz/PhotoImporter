# Photo Importer
A very simple script for importing photos and videos from a camera's memory card to the local drive.
Adds a basic date-based incrementing rename action, and deletes files off memory card as it goes.

Works, however planned improvements include:
1. Make it auto-detect the last count for the current date and continue incrementing from there (currently it just appends "b" to uniquify any filename collisions).
2. Add tests.
